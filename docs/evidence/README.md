# Verified running evidence: historical search snapshot

This folder's original artifacts record the search-only revision below. The
later integrated two-rule diagnostic starter is recorded separately in
[integrated-starter-2026-10-11/](integrated-starter-2026-10-11/README.md), with
119 passing tests, actual pause/correction exports, and current contributor
evidence. Historical artifacts and measurements are retained unchanged.

Recorded source: [`9a724d6`](https://github.com/sar1p/AI-TE-303/commit/9a724d68378242e4587b7536bffe66889c9bc86e).
Recorded on October 9, 2026, using Python 3.12.14,
Streamlit 1.65.0, and pytest
9.1.1 on Windows 11. The exported
source worktrees were clean. The later method-label correction and evidence
publication do not change the measured search algorithms.

## What ran

- Fresh remote clone, fresh virtual environment, pinned dependency installation,
  and all five verification commands succeeded. The test output reports **90 passed**.
- [Main CI](https://github.com/sar1p/AI-TE-303/actions/runs/37922918084)
  passed the tests, all scenario replays, and a one-repetition benchmark on Ubuntu.
- Four named scenarios produced 22 actual planning records.
- The local benchmark completed 5 repetitions per scenario,
  producing 110 paired measurement rows.
- The live browser accepted an obstacle update, displayed the repaired route,
  and downloaded [session-evidence.json](session-evidence.json): route cost
  12, map revision 1.

These checks cover the lead-owned search, application, adapter, and export tools.
At this recorded revision, the actual expert-system engine was pending and
adapter test functions were synthetic contract fixtures. A screen recording and
the final combined rehearsal on the teammate's laptop remain team deliverables.

## Measured comparison

Times are milliseconds. Each column is a median across independent repetitions;
repair totals and cumulative totals are calculated within each repetition before
aggregation, so phase medians need not add to the cumulative median.

| Scenario | D* Lite initial | A* initial | D* Lite repairs | A* repairs | D* Lite cumulative | A* cumulative |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| corridor-changes | 0.742 | 0.130 | 2.336 | 1.018 | 3.074 | 1.149 |
| movement-reuse | 4.903 | 0.948 | 3.085 | 7.054 | 7.984 | 8.009 |
| unreachable-recovery | 0.461 | 0.083 | 1.784 | 0.399 | 2.248 | 0.484 |
| widespread-changes | 29.313 | 6.164 | 4.696 | 12.313 | 34.015 | 18.471 |

D* Lite spends fewer processed states in these sessions but that does not always
reduce elapsed time. The corridor and unreachable fixtures favor A* overall.
The movement fixture shows less repair work with very similar cumulative timings.
The widespread fixture's initialization cost makes D* Lite slower cumulatively.
These small local measurements do not establish a universal speed advantage.

See [SEARCH_ALGORITHM.md](../SEARCH_ALGORITHM.md) for timing boundaries, counter
meanings, the fixed D* Lite-first execution order, and implementation limits.
The benchmark uses outer update-and-plan timings; the live UI reports only its
planning-call timing.

Text artifacts use LF line endings for reproducible checksums; recorded values
and screenshot bytes are unchanged.

![Repaired route after blocking the central aisle](route-demo.jpg)

The robot is at row 4, column 1. The goal remains row 4, column 11. Closing the
central aisle changes the route from 10 to 12 moves while the map revision rises
to one. This screenshot was captured from the running application.

This historical screenshot shows the pending module at the recorded revision.
